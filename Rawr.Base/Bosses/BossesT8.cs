                     3. Petrified Bark - Causes melee attacks to damage the attacker as well. 60 charges (Heroic: 120).
            Freya
                * Sunbeam - Inflicts 5,088 to 5,912 (Heroic: 7,400 to 8,600) Nature damage to enemies within 8 yards of Freya's target.
                * Attuned to Nature - Increases healing done to Freya by 4%. Starts at 150 stacks, or 600%.
                * Touch of Eonar - Heals Freya for 6,000 (Heroic: 24,000) every 1 second.
                * Lifebinder's Gift Summon - Summons an Eonar's Gift, which uses Lifebinder's Gift after ~12 seconds, healing Freya and her allies for 30% (Heroic: 60%) of their maximum health. Eonar's Gift's Pheromones negates the effect of Conservator's Grip on nearby players.
                * Summon Allies of Nature - Summons one of the three following waves of adds every minute. Total of 6 waves will be summoned. Killing any of the adds reduces the number of stacks of Freya's Attuned to Nature.
                     1. Detonating Lashers - Each of the 12 Lashers reduces Freya's Attuned to Nature by 2 stacks. They will attack with Flame Lash and Detonate for 4,163 to 4,837 (Heroic: 6,825 to 7,175) Fire damage when they die.
                     2. Elemental Adds - each one of those reduces Freya's Attuned to Nature by 10 stacks.
                            o Ancient Water Spirit - Attacks with Tidal Wave, which inflicts Frost damage in a frontal cone.
                            o Storm Lasher - Attacks with Stormbolt for 6,013 to 6,987 (Heroic: 8,788 to 10,212) Nature damage. Also casts Lightning Lash for 5,088 to 5,912 (Heroic: 6,938 to 8,062), which hits up to 3 (Heroic: 5) targets.
                            o Snaplasher - Attacks against the Snaplasher trigger Hardened Bark, which causes attacks against it to increase its damage, but decrease its movement speed (Heroic: doesn't reduce movement speed)
                     3. Ancient Conservator - Reduces Freya's Attuned to Nature by 30 stacks. Applies Conservator's Grip when he spawns, preventing players from attacking or casting spells. Getting under one of the many Healthy Spores or an Eonar's Gift negates the effect. He will also debuff players with Nature's Fury, which cause the debuffed player to damage nearby allies for 4,163 to 4,837 (Heroic: 5,550 to 6,450) Nature damage every 2 seconds for 10 seconds.
                * Nature Bomb - Summons immobile Nature Bombs around the feet of random raid members. The bombs use Nature Bomb after a few seconds, inflicting 5,850 to 6,150 (Heroic: 8,775 to 9,225) Nature damage to enemies within 10 yards and knocking them back. Used frequently 6 minutes into the fight.             */

They attack with Lava Burst, which does 4,250 to 5,750 Fire damage, and cast Storm Cloud, which allows the affected player to buff up to 4 (Heroic: 6) allies with Storm Power, which increases critical strike damage by 135% for 30 seconds.
                 3. Mages - Amira Blazeweaver • Veesha Blazeweaver or Missy Flamecuffs • Sissy Flamecuffs. They attack with Fireball, which does 3,570 to 4,830 Fire damage and an additional 900 Fire damage every 3 second for 6 seconds. They also cast Conjure Toasty Fire, which prevents the effects of Biting Cold and Freeze, and Melt Ice, which attempts to free a target encased in a frost tomb over 10 seconds. Players standing near a Toasty Fire have a chance to apply Singed when hitting with spells.

They attack with Smite, which does 3,400 to 4,600 Holy damage and can use Great Heal, which heals for 19,000 to 21,000.

              Lifebloom, Aspect of the Viper, Shamanistic Rage, Judgements of the Wise (without the Replenishment component), Spiritual Attunement, Stormstrike/Improved Stormstrike all work at least partially.
              Hymn of Hope increases the mana pool of the targets, but does not regenerate mana.
            * Shadow Crash - Shoots a shadow missile towards a random target (preferring ranged), inflicting 11,310 to 12,690 Shadow damage to the target and anyone in 10 yd radius. A dark puddle spawns under the area of impact, increasing magical damage by 100%, decreasing casting speed by 100%, healing done and mana cost by 75%.
            * Mark of the Faceless - Applies a Mark of the Faceless to a random raid member (preferring ranged), causing them to drain 5,000 hit points every 1 second, for 10 seconds, from other nearby players. Vezax will heal for 20 times more health than he has drained (100,000 for every 5,000).
            * Searing Flames - Inflicts 13,875 to 16,125 Fire damage to everybody in the room, and reduces their armor by 75%. Can be interrupted.
            * Surge of Darkness - Increases Vezax's damage by 100%, but decreases his movement speed by 55%, for 10 seconds. Cast every 60-70 seconds.
            * Saronite Barrier - Reduces all damage taken by 99%. Cast if 6 Saronite Vapors spawn and not a single one of them is destroyed. Vezax will also summon a Saronite Animus. The Barrier disappears when the Animus dies.
            * Saronite Animus - Casts Profound Darkness frequently, which does 750 Shadow damage to the entire raid and increases the Shadow damage taken by 10%.
